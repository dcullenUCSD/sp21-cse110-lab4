6. Error, result has not been declared in the scope of line 13

#Part 1b
1. The code will print 3, becase the for loop exits when i is equal to the length of prices, which is 3.
2. The code will print 150, which is the discounted price of the last entry in the for loop, 300.
3. The code will print 150, which is the last price rounded in the for loop (150).
4. The function will return the array [50, 100, 150] which is the prices array given a 0.5x discount
5. There will be an error, since i is being called outside of its scope.
6. There will be an error, since discountedPrice is being called outside of its scope.
7. Code will print 150, since it is the last way the value is changed in the for loop
8. The function will return the array [50, 100, 150] which is the prices array given a 0.5x discount
9. There will be an error as the code tries to change a constant value.
10. There will be an error as the code tries to change a constant value.
11. There will be an error as the code tries to change a constant value.
12. A) student.name
    B) student["Grad Year"]
    C) student.greeting
    D) student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E) student.courseLoad[0]
13. A) '32', 2 is converted to a string and is appended
    B) 1, 3 is converted to an int and subtracted
    C) 3, null maps to 0
    D) 3null, null is converted to a string 'null' and appended
    E) 4, true is converted to 1
    F) 0, both false and null are converted to 0
    G) NaN, undefined is converted to NaN and makes the expression NaN
    H) '3undefined', undefined is converted to a string and appended
14. A) true, 2 becomes a number and is greater than 1
    B) true, the longer string is greater
    C) true, '2' becomes a number and 2 == 2
    D) false, '2' and 2 are different types
    E) false, true becomes 1 which is not equal to 2
    F) true, 2 as a boolean is true, which equals true
15. === does not convert the types while == does type conversion. If two variables are different types, === immediately returns false.

17. [2,4,6], modifyArray will make a new array, and for each entry in the initial array it will call doSomething on that value. doSomething multiplies the value by two. The new value is then pushed to newArr, and eventually returned.
